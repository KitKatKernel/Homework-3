# Employee Payroll Tracker (Week 3)

## What is This Project?

This week's project is an Employee Payroll Tracker application that allows payroll managers to view and manage employee payroll data.

- **Why Did I Make This?**: To learn and write JavaScript by adding some code to starter code and create a dynamic and responsive application that can manage employee payroll data.
- **What's in It?**: The application includes a table and button, the button prompts for entering employee details, and then displays that data in a table, and logs average salary of those employees added and chooses a random employee's details to the console.
- **What Did I Learn?**: This project helped me understand the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation, and I learned more about working with arrays and objects, using loops and conditionals, and handling user inputs. The most important lesson I learned is actually reading the README... I initially started this project from scratch and got pretty far until I was going through the README and hadn't realized there was starter code this week... I guess the silver-lining is that I learned a lot about tables like how to create a new row and populate cells, and using an object to append those cells.
